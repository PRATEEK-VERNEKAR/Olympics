# 🏅 The OlympicHub 🚀

Welcome to the OlympicHub project! This project aims to analyze and visualize data related to the Olympic Games. The Olympics is a prestigious international sports event that brings together athletes from various countries to compete in a wide range of sports. By analyzing historical Olympic data, we can gain insights into athletes' performance, medal distribution, and the evolution of sports over time.

The primary objective of this project is to develop a user-friendly web application that fosters a global connection among millions of sports enthusiasts, and to inculcate the spirits of the games that have been preserved over the centuries.

A detailed video with the demonstration of the project has been uploaded and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrYFimZ_1aA).

## Introduction 🚀

The project is divided into two parts :

- The WebApp
- Data Analytics

  ### WebApp 🌐

  The OlympicHub was created using the **MERN stack** with the web-app serving as an entertainment platform for the fans through which they can access the schedules of the games, current medal tallies, recent and future matchups and also the latest news and alerts provided by the association on a users live-feed. The app also has quizzes related to the games and also introduces a "Follower System" by which the fans can subscribe to their favourite players and recieve the updates posted by them.

  The players and technical staffs are differentiated by the fans by an user login authentication system built using **passport.js**.

  ### Data Analytics 📊

  The data analytics part is implemented through a Streamlit WebApp which is written in python. It includes the analysis of the previous olympic games, medal tallies according to the countries in any specified olympic games and the analysis of individual players' performance in those games.
